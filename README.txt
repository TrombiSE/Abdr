Hello
I want to make a snake game with some surprises
I indicated all the details in project
Please check it

At github you will see 3 classes:
SnakeGameMain(Main class(Start on it))
Snake(Support class)
Apple(Suppot class)


At the start you will see 5 apples;
Green apple just  add to your length 1 more square :D
Red apple Will divide your length by 2
Yellow will speed up your snake
black will kill you
blue apple will set all apples to the new random position


If you find some bags or you want some more in my game please inform me
